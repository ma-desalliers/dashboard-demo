      "description": "Blast media can be defined as any abrasive that cleans, removes, finishes, or prepares a surface. The media is propelled with the use of compressed air or via centrifugal force by a bladed wheel. The media impacts the surface to be finished to erode any unwanted materials, to prepare a surface for a coating to be applied, or to provide a desired surface finish. Blast media is often referred to, incorrectly, as “sandblasting media”. Silica sand should never be used in blasting processes.
