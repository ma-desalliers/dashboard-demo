      "description": "The vibratory finishing process is the movement of a mass of media, parts, water, and compounds within the confinement of a machine. The machine provides a source of containment as well as the means to provide the motion required for finishing. The vibratory finishing media and compound work in conjunction to clean the surface of the workpieces providing the desired finish. Bowls and tubs are the most common configurations of vibratory equipment. Vibratory processes are often used to deburr, burnish, descale, clean, and polish.",

      "description": "Blast media can be defined as any abrasive that cleans, removes, finishes, or prepares a surface. The media is propelled with the use of compressed air or via centrifugal force by a bladed wheel. The media impacts the surface to be finished to erode any unwanted materials, to prepare a surface for a coating to be applied, or to provide a desired surface finish. Blast media is often referred to, incorrectly, as “sandblasting media”. Silica sand should never be used in blasting processes.
