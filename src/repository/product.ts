    "description": "Like steel shot, steel grit is a very common metallic blasting abrasive. Grit is different from steel shot in that it is randomly shaped and angular. Steel grit, given its sharp shape, will etch or erode surfaces.\nIt comes in a variety of shapes and levels of hardness. It has a high bulk density like steel shot and can have wear-and-tear effects on equipment if it is not properly outfitted to handle the media.\nSteel grit is sized via a screening process. A size of steel grit will contain a variety of particles within a set range for that given size. The larger the size number, the smaller the steel grit particle.\nAs with any steel media, ferrous contamination against the surface being blasted will occur. Because of its durability and low-attrition rate, steel grit is a popular choice in wheel blast equipment and properly outfitted blast rooms.",

    "description": "Compounds are available for buffing and polishing applications for various types of surface materials and stages within the surface finishing application. Buffing operations can generally be divided into two operations: cutting down and coloring: Cutting down is a preliminary step that uses a coarser grade buffing compound. In some cases, this process can yield an acceptable appearance. Coloring is a lighter duty buffing intended to bring up the luster and polish the work surface. The coloring compounds use finer mesh abrasives to enhance and brighten the work piece. Buffing wheels and compounds work together, either to carry the abrasives across the work surface to cut and color, or to generate sufficient frictional heat to impart a polished finish. Compounds are available in liquid and solid forms for use with buffing wheels. Grease-less compounds are available in grit ranges from 60 to 600. The compounds are applied to a wheel and are designed to deburr, blend machine lines, and remove surface imperfections. Each compound is designed for specific alloys and plastics. Note: Buffing is a low RPM operation. The wheel and compound generates enough heat to help 'pop' the polish. Too high an RPM can prevent the luster and color, creating a surface haze, either from excessive heat and/or wheel frays that whip the work surface.",

    "name": "Vibratory Compounds",
    "description": "Vibratory compounds are designed to work with the vibratory media to make the process efficient and productive. There are a number of considerations to take into account when selecting vibratory compounds. Two key considerations would be the material makeup of the work piece and the objective of the process. The function of compounds within the mass is to keep your parts clean, keep the media clean and lubricate the mass itself as it travels through your machine. Compounds can also provide ancillary benefits such as rust protection. Compounds are an integral part of the mass finishing equation. Burnishing and polishing are impossible without the correct compound to supplement the process. Even standard parts deburring applications are dependent on the correct compound. Liquid compounds are the most commonly used compounds in vibratory mass finishing applications. Compounds can be manually added to a process or automatically added to the equipment using an integrated metering pump. Some liquid compounds can be recycled through a vibratory mass finishing system by using centrifuge wastewater systems. Powder compounds can also be used, and quite effective, depending on the process requirements. Incredible results have been achieved with unique mass finishing paste processes. Compound pastes are often used for process in which a high level of cutting may be required. Paste processes are also frequently used for polishing processes. Vibratory mass finishing compounds provide a combination of performance components, but the main five goals of mass finishing applications tend to be: Cleaning is one of the primary functions of vibratory compounds. Proper compound selection will clean and emulsify the oils or coolants from the parts, then remove it from the process channel. Compound is also critical by keeping the media clean and prevents glazing. Glazed media loses its cutting ability, which will increase processing time. Deburring is a function whereby compound removes residue or contaminants on the work piece and allows the media to cut more efficiently. Deburring compound allows media to slide over the part, removing burrs. Without deburring compound, the media mass would not work as effectively. Burnishing compound is utilized to brighten the appearance of the parts being processed. The enhanced appearance can be accomplished with many types of vibratory media however porcelain as well as steel media are typically used. Burnishing compounds add color and luster to the parts as they are processed. Inhibiting properties will help prevent corrosion during the vibratory process. Typically, the concentration level of inhibitors is too low to provide any protection after the process is completed. With ferrous metals, other steps to dry the parts or apply higher concentrations of corrosion protection will need to be implemented to avoid further rusting post-process.",

Bonded abrasives come in a variety of grains, grit sizes, bonding compositions, shapes, and sizes to fit many applications. Bonded Abrasives are a mixture of abrasive grains, fillers, and bonding materials. The bonding agents can be resin, rubber, glass, or other materials. As the wheel spins against the surface of a work piece, the grains fracture and wear away. As the top layer wears, a new layer of grains is exposed.",

    "name": "Coated Abrasives",
    "description": "The term “coated abrasive” indicates how the abrasive is bonded to each product. Coated abrasive products consist of a backing material such as paper, cotton or polyester cloth, film, or vulcanized fiber. To make a jumbo roll of coated abrasives, an initial ‘make or base’ coat of resin is applied to the backing. The abrasive grain is electrostatically applied onto the base coat surface, to ensure the ratio of coverage and the grain is positioned properly. The second ‘top or size’ coating of resin is applied to lock in the abrasive particles. Additional coatings are available for specific applications to maximize performance. A few of the common coatings include grinding aid to prevent heat build-up, stearate to prevent material loading, or anti-static to reduce dust build up. The jumbo rolls of coated abrasives products are then converted into: sanding belts, discs, sheets, rolls, and specialty products like flap wheels, flap discs, cartridge rolls and quick change discs. The most common grains used are aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, zirconia alumina, and ceramic. Additionally, super abrasives such as industrial diamonds are used for more specialized applications. Coated abrasives are created with a wide range of grit sizes as well. Larger grit-sized products like 24 – 60 grit are best for stock removal and deburring. The 80-220 grits are commonly used for blending, surface prep and graining. Grits 280 – 3000 grit, will accomplish smooth surface and pre-polish finishes.",

Vibratory bowls are used for a variety of processes and applications including deburring, fine finishing, smoothing, burnishing, and edge break or radiusing. Types of Vibratory Bowls: Standard Bowls – The most common and economical type of bowl that is ideal for most deburring or radiusing processes. Ball Burnishing Bowls – These are heavy-duty bowls intended to turn heavy steel media and parts around to achieve bright, burnished finishes. Batch or Flat Bottom Bowls – These systems are suited for larger parts that may not unload as well in a standard system. Cob Dryers - The most common dryers used in mass finishing or vibratory tumbling processes are cob dry. These units are essentially a vibratory finishing bowl with a heating element located in the base of the machine. The heated cob dryer provides a great means to dry and to some extent can slightly brighten or polish the workpiece. Vibratory Tubs: Tubs are a great consideration if your parts are larger or may not travel well through a bowl configuration. Tubs are available in a broad range of sizes. SurfacePrep offers entry-level, small systems for those with a limited budget, all the way up to large tubs that can be developed to meet the most stringent processing requirements.",

    "name": "Wastewater Systems",
    "description": "Mass finishing processes are typically a wet process, involving water and compounds. The water used in those process can contain used media, compounds, or particulates from the work pieces themselves.\nSome processes will be set up as a closed drain process in which the water is circulated through the machine during the cycle. This method uses less water, but the water is eventually flushed out of the system. The other method is an open drain, or flow through process in which fresh water and compound are metered into the mass finishing equipment while processing. Either of these systems will eventually require dealing with wastewater, also known as effluent, at some point. Occasionally, the effluent is transferred to a settling tank or lifting station until it can be processed.\nMunicipalities differ significantly regarding what forms of effluent can go directly to drain. In almost all cases effluent must be treated prior to going to drain. SurfacePrep recommends that you always check with your local municipality in regards to what can safely be disposed of via drain. Properly dealing with wastewater is a critical consideration in determining what process works best for your application.\nThe two basic classifications of equipment that deal with effluent, or wastewater, are:\nFiltration System – A filtration system is usually a less expensive way to remove the very large particulate from your effluent or wastewater stream. It is difficult to remove all contaminants from effluent using mechanical filtration. Some particulates can be too fine to be removed via a filter.\nCentrifuge System – These systems process the effluent by introducing the wastewater into a spinning bucket or container. The heavy particulate, typically a clay from ceramic media, and the fine particulates, or possibly flashing or burrs from the work pieces gravitate towards the outer walls of the spinning bucket as effluent flows through. These buckets, or sometimes fixed containers, are then either manually removed and cleaned or scraped clean by a scraping blade in an automated system. The recycled water is then returned either to the machine or to a tank or lifting station to be utilized again.",

    "description": "Compressed air is a necessity for most of the equipment used in industrial manufacturing and finishing. Whether it is a low-production paint pump, pneumatic hand tool, or a high production, multi-pressure pot blast room, they all require compressed air to operate. The common types of compressors used in the industrial markets are pistons or rotary screws. Piston compressors are an older technology and less efficient, while rotary screw compressors offer more energy efficient performance, quality and reliability. Many can be configured to include refrigerated dryers, coalescing, and particulate filters and oil/water separators.",

Cabinets can first be separated into two basic categories: Suction Blast Cabinets – these cabinets utilize the Venturi effect to deliver the abrasive to the blast gun via suction where it is combined with your compressed air source and propelled against the workpiece. Pressure Blast Cabinets – these cabinets use a pressurized vessel to contain the abrasive. In these systems, the abrasive is metered into the compressed air stream and travels the length of the blast hose under pressure to exit the nozzle. Suction and pressure cabinets are two different tools and selecting them depends on your application, abrasive, and the needs of the job. It can get confusing when comparing all the different models and manufacturers. SurfacePrep is there to help you find the best equipment to meet your blasting needs.",

Dust collection systems can be integrated into your surface enhancement process to provide recovery, reclamation, and cleaning of abrasive media for re-use. In air blast systems, the dust collection system is sized to provide the proper CFM and static to recover and separate reusable media from the dust and debris, but not pull over good media. Blast rooms utilize dust collection to provide airflow to clear out the work area and contain the dust. In wheel blast equipment, dust collection is used to pull debris and dust from the air wash system. Dust collectors are equipped with filter-cleaning mechanisms. Most will utilize an air-pulse mechanism to free build-up and restore airflow. The air-pulse cleaning can be manual or automatic. In the past many collectors used filter bags, but the majority have transitioned to higher-efficiency cartridge filters to comply with clean air regulations. Small collectors come equipped with a clean-out drawer or a small drum to capture dust and debris. Applications that generate a higher volume of dust may require additional equipment that can dump waste into 55-gallon drums or super sacks. There are options to prevent damage from the ignition of combustible dust. Spark arrestors help extinguish a spark as it travels through the ductwork or explosion vents will direct a blast away from personnel and equipment. Wet dust collectors are also available to reduce the potential for damage from combustible dust.",

    "name": "Steel Shot",
    "description": "One of the most common metallic abrasives is steel shot. Steel shot can sometimes be confused as steel grit, but they are very different products. Steel shot is spherical in shape. Steel shot will provide a smoother surface finish than steel grit. Steel shot comes in a variety of sizes and levels of hardness. The bulk density is very high and must be taken into consideration with how that might affect your blasting equipment. Appropriate equipment needs to be implemented in order to properly use steel blasting media. Processes using steel shot must be able to tolerate a level of ferrous residue on the workpiece. When steel breaks down, it will leave ferrous contamination on the parts being blasted. Because of its durability and low-attrition rate, steel shot is a popular choice in wheel blast equipment and properly outfitted blast rooms. Steel shot is sized by screening. The sizing numbers for shot pertain to the actual size of the shot particulate, not a mesh size. The larger the number designation for steel shot the larger the size of shot. Low-carbon steel shot is available as well.",

It is ideal for general cleaning, restoration work, and rust and scale removal. The angular shape cleans surfaces and provides a uniform mil profile with low particle embedment. Crushed glass can also enhance the natural luster of the surface without leaving any kind of discoloration. It is a low-cost abrasive that can be an effective substitute for slag and mineral abrasives. Crushed glass has a very low recyclability and is normally a single-use abrasive.",

    "name": "Vibratory Compounds",
    "description": "Vibratory compounds are designed to work with the vibratory media to make the process efficient and productive. There are a number of considerations to take into account when selecting vibratory compounds. Two key considerations would be the material makeup of the work piece and the objective of the process. The function of compounds within the mass is to keep your parts clean, keep the media clean and lubricate the mass itself as it travels through your machine. Compounds can also provide ancillary benefits such as rust protection. Compounds are an integral part of the mass finishing equation. Burnishing and polishing are impossible without the correct compound to supplement the process. Even standard parts deburring applications are dependent on the correct compound. Liquid compounds are the most commonly used compounds in vibratory mass finishing applications. Compounds can be manually added to a process or automatically added to the equipment using an integrated metering pump. Some liquid compounds can be recycled through a vibratory mass finishing system by using centrifuge wastewater systems. Powder compounds can also be used, and quite effective, depending on the process requirements. Incredible results have been achieved with unique mass finishing paste processes. Compound pastes are often used for process in which a high level of cutting may be required. Paste processes are also frequently used for polishing processes. Vibratory mass finishing compounds provide a combination of performance components, but the main five goals of mass finishing applications tend to be: Cleaning is one of the primary functions of vibratory compounds. Proper compound selection will clean and emulsify the oils or coolants from the parts, then remove it from the process channel. Compound is also critical by keeping the media clean and prevents glazing. Glazed media loses its cutting ability, which will increase processing time. Deburring is a function whereby compound removes residue or contaminants on the work piece and allows the media to cut more efficiently. Deburring compound allows media to slide over the part, removing burrs. Without deburring compound, the media mass would not work as effectively. Burnishing compound is utilized to brighten the appearance of the parts being processed. The enhanced appearance can be accomplished with many types of vibratory media however porcelain as well as steel media are typically used. Burnishing compounds add color and luster to the parts as they are processed. Inhibiting properties will help prevent corrosion during the vibratory process. Typically, the concentration level of inhibitors is too low to provide any protection after the process is completed. With ferrous metals, other steps to dry the parts or apply higher concentrations of corrosion protection will need to be implemented to avoid further rusting post-process.",

The incorporation of the chromium oxide into the aluminum oxide crystal structure slightly increases the toughness of the grain while reducing the friability in comparison to white aluminum oxide. In comparison to brown fused aluminum oxide, pink fused aluminum oxide is harder, more aggressive, and has sharper cutting ability.\n\nPink aluminum oxide is exceptional for the manufacturing of vitrified bonded abrasives allowing for grinding on hardened steels and alloys with high tensile strength. Pink aluminum oxide is mostly used for grinding and sharpening applications. Pink aluminum oxide can be used on non-ferrous metals, aluminum, zinc, brass, bronze, copper, wood, synthetics, and paints.",

The most common form is brown fused. Brown fused aluminum oxide is a general-purpose, loose grain abrasive that is used in abrasive blasting, polishing, lapping, or other finishing applications. SurfacePrep also supplies white fused aluminum oxide for applications that need minimal foreign contaminant.\n\nWhen blast equipment is paired with a media recovery system, aluminum oxide offers multiple turns/recyclability before it breaks down. Typically propelled by air, aluminum oxide acts as a powerful, multi-edged abrasive that will penetrate the work piece while creating an exceptionally clean and uniquely etched surface. This unique surface finish is excellent preparation for an application of paint or powder coating via anchor pattern creation.\n\nAluminum oxide can be used on a variety of materials such as ferrous metal, steel, many metal alloys, stainless steel, glass, ceramic, marble, granite, stone, and other hard surfaces.",

Wire rod or bar stock as small as ¼” in diameter and up to 4″ can be processed in this series of machines. This unit is also capable of cleaning squares, flats and other shapes. Skew Roll: This machine is used to clean the outside surface of cylindrical objects such as pipe, large bar and even some tanks. Rollers are positioned throughout the blast cabinet and provide forward movement as well as rotation on the product to be blasted. Several blast wheels are mounted throughout the cabinet to insure proper blast cleaning coverage. The roller speed can be adjusted to your specific cleaning requirements. Coil Wire: Coils are loaded onto mandrel mounted on the door of the unit. During the wheel blast process the mandrel turns which exposes various sections of the coil for better exposure to the blast stream.",
